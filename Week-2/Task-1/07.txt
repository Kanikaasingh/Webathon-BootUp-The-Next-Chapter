Q7). What is a callback function and why is it important in javascript
// A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
function greet(name, callback)
{
    console.log("Hello, " + name); // Executes first
    callback(); // Calls the callback function
}
    
// This function will be used as a callback
function whatsup() 
{
    console.log("whatsup!"); // Executes after the greet function finishes
}
    
// Calling the greet function and passing say whatsup as a callback.
greet("Kanika", whatsup); 
   
    /* 
    Why are callbacks important?
    1. Callbacks allow functions to be executed after another function completes.
    2. They help in handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file reading, or timers.
    3. They improve modularity by keeping the code clean and structured.

console.log("End"); // Executes before setTimeout callback
